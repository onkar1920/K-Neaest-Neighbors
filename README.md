# K-Neaest-Neighbors
    Using KNN
Import KNeighborsClassifier from scikit learn.
Create a KNN model instance with n_neighbors=1
Fit this KNN model to the training data.
Predictions and Evaluations
Let's evaluate our KNN model!
Use the predict method to predict values using your KNN model and Xtest.
Create a confusion matrix , Accuracy and classification report.
Choosing a K Value (Hyper Parameter Tuning)
Let's go ahead and use the elbow method to pick a good K Value!

Create a for loop that trains various KNN models with different k values, then keep track of the accuracy for each of these models with a list.
Now create the following plot using the information from your for loop.
Retrain with new K Value
Retrain your model with the best K value (up to you to decide what you want) and re-do the classification report and the confusion matrix.
Create the model again
Get the confusion matrix , accuracy score and classification report
Get the Mean accuracy with cross val score
